//! Object-safe coordinator surface for local and distributed Chronon backends.

/// Job/runs/revisions **admin** for server integration, UI server functions, and macros.
///
/// Object-safe (`dyn`-compatible) so hosts can hold `Arc<dyn ChrononCoordinatorBackend>` without
/// knowing whether jobs are administered through an in-process Chronon runtime or across a
/// distributed / HTTP boundary. Fluent schedule construction is Chronon's
/// [`chronon_scheduler::JobBuilder`] (this crate wraps it with Valence via [`crate::JobBuilder`]).
///
/// **Distributed mode latency:** `upsert_job` / `pause_job` / `resume_job` persist immediately;
/// automatic cron firing for a new or updated job is picked up on the next coordinator tick.
/// `run_now` persists a `queued` run immediately; a worker claims it on the next worker poll.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use chronon_coordinator::ChrononCoordinatorBackend;
///
/// # async fn schedule_and_run(
/// #     backend: &dyn ChrononCoordinatorBackend,
/// #     valence: &valence::Valence,
/// #     job: chronon_coordinator::Job,
/// # ) -> chronon_coordinator::Result<()> {
/// backend.upsert_job_with_valence(valence, job.clone()).await?;
/// let run_id = backend.run_now(&job.job_id).await?;
/// let run = backend.get_run(&run_id).await?;
/// assert!(run.is_some());
/// # Ok(())
